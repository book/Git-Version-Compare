NAME

    Git::Version::Compare - Functions to compare Git versions

SYNOPSIS

    use Git::Version::Compare qw( cmp_git );

    # result: 1.2.3 1.7.0.rc0 1.7.4.rc1 1.8.3.4 1.9.3 2.0.0.rc2 2.0.3 2.3.0.rc1
    my @versions = sort cmp_git qw(
      1.7.4.rc1 1.9.3 1.7.0.rc0 2.0.0.rc2 1.2.3 1.8.3.4 2.3.0.rc1 2.0.3
    );

DESCRIPTION

    Git::Version::Compare contains a selection of subroutines that make
    dealing with Git-related things (like versions) a little bit easier.

    The strings to compare can be version numbers, tags from "git.git" or the
    output of "git version" or "git describe".

    These routines collect the knowledge about Git versions that was
    accumulated while developing Git::Repository.
